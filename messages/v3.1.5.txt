Emacs Pro Essentials v3.1.5 Update
==================================

- Added default emacs binding for UNDO.

- Changed the kill ring behavior with respect to the clipboard. Now when multiple regions are killed
  or copied, the clipboard takes on all those regions joined together with Newlines. This is the
  default Sublime behavior now supported by this plugin.

  This plugin still stores them as separate regions, and yank still works the way it used to, with
  one exception: if you yank multiple regions into a single cursor, the regions are joined together
  with Newlines like the clipboard. Previously we'd just yank back the first region. When there's
  more than one cursor, the regions will be yanked into those cursors as before.

- Fixed an issue with setting the target column for next and previous line commands after running
  the s-expression commands. This was interfering with the ctrl+u command.
