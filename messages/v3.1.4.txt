Emacs Pro Essentials v3.1.4 Update
==================================

Improvements to the All Complete functionality, for when identifiers start with
non-word characters, e.g., "@" in ruby or coffeescript.

Bug fix: Fixed a problem with zap to char command which caused the zapped
characters to ALWAYS be appended to the most recent kill ring entry.

Bug fix: Fix to the camel case/underscore command which caused the selection to
drift after a conversion in either direction between underscore and camel case.
