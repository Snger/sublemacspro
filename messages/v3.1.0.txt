Emacs Pro Essentials v3.1.0 Update
==================================

New feature: Pinned Tabs. When you pin a tab, it will never automatically be closed with the Close
Stale Views command. A pinned tab displays a pushpin icon in the message area. The default binding
is "ctrl+x P".

New Feature: Delete Blank Lines command. This is the Emacs "ctrl+x ctrl+o" command, which deletes
extra blank lines around point.

Enhancement: Open Line command. The ctrl+o command now honors the numeric argument.

Enhancement: Delete White Space command. This command now supports an argument for the number of
spaces to keep. The default is 0. This value can be overridden by supplying a numeric argument. So
"meta+2 meta+backslash" would leave 2 spaces.

Enhancement: Negative and 0 arguments to the ``ctrl+k`` command now work properly. An argument of 0
means "kill to the beginning of the line" and a negative argument means "kill the previous N lines".
