Sublemacs Pro v2.1.7 Update
=============================

Fixed a bug where using the previous search string would fail.

Implemented a better version of emacs "switch-to-buffer" which sorts the views by last used time, so
that you get the same experience as regular emacs. Also the top two views are switched so you can
easily switch back and forth between them:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "b"], "command": "sbp_switch_to_view"},

for the original emacs key binding.

New feature: built-in auto-completion across all views. I have been using the All Autocomplete
plugin for a while but occasionally couldn't understand why things were not being found. I
discovered that there are two reasons: one is it has a built-in limit of 20 views to search, and the
other was that there are issues with some syntaxes which prevent some symbols from being found. I
have fixed both those problems to the best of my ability.

It is disabled by default.

To enable it, add the following plugin setting:

    "sbp_use_internal_complete_all_buffers": true,
