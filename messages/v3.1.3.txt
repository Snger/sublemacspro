Emacs Pro Essentials v3.1.3 Update
==================================

Bug Fix: Don't disable active mark mode when starting a search, unless the search was started with a
selection. E.g., if you activate the mark and perform a search, the mark will be active when you
finish the search. But if you double click a word to highlight it and then start a search, the mark
will not be active.

Enhancement: Remember the buffer last access time between sessions.
